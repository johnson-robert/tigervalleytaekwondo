                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>I believe that all people do well if they can. That problems have solutions. People struggle; that is too be expected. It is my hope to support you during these times of change. Experience has taught me that during struggle, there is no room for judgement or shame. Working as a team yields greater results. I approach my work seeking to understand your concerns, then collaborate with you on how best to reach your goals. I believe that all people are geared toward growth and healing. My role is to join on the journey of discovering your strengths, talents, and insights so you can move forward a more present and intentional participant in your life and community.  </p>
                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am a licensed clinical social worker with experience working with adults in individual, and group therapy. I provide therapy services for people experiencing mood disorders, emotional distress, depression, anxiety, interpersonal difficulties, or have a history of past trauma, or addiction. </p>
                <h3>Theoretical Orientation</h3>
                <p>My theoretical orientation is Humanistic, and person centered which I integrate with specific interventions from other orientations such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), Motivational interviewing, Solution focused therapy, and Collaborative Problem Solving. I embrace a trauma sensitive and informed model of care to best help you make the changes you wish to make.<p>
